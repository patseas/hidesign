              <h4 class="center">Reviews&nbsp;Airbnb</h4>
              <p class="testimonials-text">Fantastic apartment in Athens!&nbsp;
                <br>Great location - quiet neighborhood near the top of the hill. Great breezes through the apartment - light and airy. Amazing views over Athens. Great Greek takeaway food options nearby (To Omorfo especially). The best up market shopping in Athens nearby too if you're into that (I miraculously managed to steer my wife past these so that we could see some historical sites!). Great layout to apartment and tastefully decorated, everything that you need and lovely breakfast foods provided by Pagona - thank you! Highly recommend using Pagona's friend for airport transfers. Great for our one year old - Pagona even had a high chair - something that I would recommend to all owners, as much to protect your furniture as for our convenience! Pagona even arranged for some items that we accidentally left to be sent to us. We loved our stay in Athens, and could have stayed longer, and a lot of this was due to this great apartment. Thanks Pagona, we will be back!</p>

              <p class="testimonials-text">Stylish City apartment in an excellent location&nbsp;
                <br>This apartment is very well designed with well thought out layout. There is everything a guest needs as well as lovely extra touches. The owners are extremely helpful and welcoming.&nbsp;
                <br>Everything was very clean with crisp cotton bedding and soft towels, the beds are comfortable and whilst it is a smallish City apartment, the living areas are open and feel spacious, we thoroughly enjoyed our stay here.&nbsp;
                <br>The location was ideal, plenty of good restaurants and shops within a few minutes’ walk, a small supermarket on the nearest corner. The main tourist attractions were only 15-20 minutes easy walking away, it couldn't have worked better.</p>

              <p class="testimonials-text">A lovely stay in July&nbsp;
                <br>We had a very good time in this apartment, located in a quiet area, near to the center of Athens. This apartment is really pretty and cozy, nicely decorated, with a new kitchen and a lovely balcony all around, in front of the pine tree park. It's sunny, really clean and well-maintained. Pagona, the owner, is very nice and open-minded. We spent lovely holidays and we would recommend this property to our friends or relatives.</p>

              <h3>Traditional Stoned House In Kea<br>VINCENT L. - AUGust 2015</h3>
              <p class="testimonials-text">Our favorite place in Greece !&nbsp;
                <br>This was our second time in this charming house! Sometimes you are disappointed as it doesn't look exactly like in your memory. But we found it like when we left 2 years ago. Still nicely decorated/furnished and fully equiped. The kids (14, 12, 7) and the cat liked it too. The location is perfect: within the harbor town of Korissia, nearby shops and tavernas - but far enough from the dock to be quiet too. The upper terrace with the bbq is a big plus and the view is outstanding. You don't even need a car if you want to relax. Bus and taxi station is nearby. Everything you need in the house (from hot water to washing machine and much more...) perfectly works and the mattresses are really comfortable. Hara is a great owner, always available if necessary (by e-mail, phone or text message) and very accommodating (time of arrival, departure) To make it short I would say we feel at home at Hara's . We will definitely come back again. Thanks and see you next time!</p>
